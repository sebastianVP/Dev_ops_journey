Instructor- DevOps Engineering - Colien Chartier

Colien Chartier- CEO and co founder of LAYERCI

- Learn fundamental DevOps concepts, so that they can go towards the DevOps engineering role.
- Outline:
    - Code Review Automtation.
    - Deployment strategies.
    - Application Performance Management.
    
    # I. **FIRST QUESTION:  What is a DevOps?**
    
    **A methodology that helps engineering teams build products by continuosly getting user feedback.**

    CURRENT PROCESS:
    
    1. Planning : take a set of features that you want a build, specification
    2. Code : Developer of your team build the features to realese.
    3. Buid: for a website , you might wake the source code and bundle it inot JavaScript that user’s browser could run, for a video [game.you](http://game.you) might make releases
    4. Test: Automatically or manal, automatic testing is usually colloquially known as **Continuos integration** Manual testint is colloquially known as quality  assurance, QA.
    5. Release, Continuos deployment strategies  releasing and deploying all happens automatically after a change is known to be good.
    6. Deploy: Deploying means it’s released to your users for a website. It would mean it’s publicity accesible on the internet. For a CD-ROM, your bundle your things onto a CD and you distribute it. For a mobile release, your build the artifact and you submit it to app store. And then the App store would review it an that your users could download.
    7. Operate:Operating is primarily things like scaling, making sure that enough resources wxist for the load, adding more servers as required, configuring things dealing with architectural problems, essentially.
    8. Monitor: Monitoring, so as your users use your software, and especially as the submit things and start jobs and create posts on your forum, you want yo make sure that thow posts are all healthy.
    
    Finally your take all this feedbacl and you put it back to the planning stage. So the planning stage takes all the user feedback takes all of the things that the operations and deployment, teams learned about deploying and scalling the product. And the use that to build out new features.
    
    **People says: “OUR COMPANY USES DEVOPS”**
    
    ## II. DEVOPS ENGINEERING DEFINITION
    
    Practual use of DevOps within software engineering teams. Being able to build, test, realease and cominto application. 
    
    ## DEVOPS ENGINEERING PILLARS
    
    1. Pull request automation
    2. Deployment automation
    3. Application Performance managment.

    1. Pull request automation: helps developer build things faster, and helps them understand whether their proposed change is good, faster, 
    2.  Deployment automation: helps your deploy your code in a way that users don’t complain. Again, facebook has lots of deployment automation, because if they just threw their code out into the void every time a developer made a change there’d be houndres of millions of complaints.
    3. Application Performance Managment  is automation aroung making sure that things area healthy. So, automatically detecting downtime, automatically waking someone up. If you known, the site goes down overnight, automtically rolling back things if there’s a problem.
    
    ### PULL REQUEST AUTOMATION
    
    - Developer feedback cycle.
    - Developers share code changes using git tools like github, gitlab and bitbucket
    - A set of code changes in git tools is called a ‘pull request’ or ‘merge request’
    - if Pull requests are approved, the code changes can go into he main codebase
    
    ### what can you automate?
    
    - continuos integration
    - per change ephemeral enviroments
    - automated security scanning
    - notification to reviewers
    
    **Goal as DevOps Engineer**
    
    HELP DEVeloper change proposals get reviewed and merged within 24 hours of when they are made.
    
    ### DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION
    
    ### APPLICATION PERFORMANCE MANAGMENT
