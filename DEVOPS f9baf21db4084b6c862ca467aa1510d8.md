- Outline:
    - Code Review Automtation.
    - Deployment strategies.

    # LESSON 1: **FIRST QUESTION:  What is a DevOps?**
    
    **A methodology that helps engineering teams build products by continuosly getting user feedback.**

    CURRENT PROCESS:
    
    1. Planning : take a set of features that you want a build, specification
    2. Code : Developer of your team build the features to realese.
    3. Buid: for a website , you might wake the source code and bundle it inot JavaScript that user’s browser could run, for a video [game.you](http://game.you) might make releases
    4. Test: Automatically or manal, automatic testing is usually colloquially known as **Continuos integration** Manual testint is colloquially known as quality  assurance, QA.
    5. Release, Continuos deployment strategies  releasing and deploying all happens automatically after a change is known to be good.
    6. Deploy: Deploying means it’s released to your users for a website. It would mean it’s publicity accesible on the internet. For a CD-ROM, your bundle your things onto a CD and you distribute it. For a mobile release, your build the artifact and you submit it to app store. And then the App store would review it an that your users could download.
    7. Operate:Operating is primarily things like scaling, making sure that enough resources wxist for the load, adding more servers as required, configuring things dealing with architectural problems, essentially.
    8. Monitor: Monitoring, so as your users use your software, and especially as the submit things and start jobs and create posts on your forum, you want yo make sure that thow posts are all healthy.
    
    Finally your take all this feedbacl and you put it back to the planning stage. So the planning stage takes all the user feedback takes all of the things that the operations and deployment, teams learned about deploying and scalling the product. And the use that to build out new features.
    
    **People says: “OUR COMPANY USES DEVOPS”**
    
    ## II. DEVOPS ENGINEERING DEFINITION
    
    Practical use of DevOps within software engineering teams. Being able to build, test, realease and cominto application. 
    
    ## DEVOPS ENGINEERING PILLARS
    
    1. Pull request automation
    2. Deployment automation
    3. Application Performance managment.
    
    ![pillars.png](DEVOPS%20f9baf21db4084b6c862ca467aa1510d8/pillars.png)
    
    1. Pull request automation: helps developer build things faster, and helps them understand whether their proposed change is good, faster, 
    2.  Deployment automation: helps your deploy your code in a way that users don’t complain. Again, facebook has lots of deployment automation, because if they just threw their code out into the void every time a developer made a change there’d be houndres of millions of complaints.
    3. Application Performance Managment  is automation aroung making sure that things area healthy. So, automatically detecting downtime, automatically waking someone up. If you known, the site goes down overnight, automtically rolling back things if there’s a problem.
    
    ### PULL REQUEST AUTOMATION
    
    - Developer feedback cycle.
    - Developers share code changes using git tools like github, gitlab and bitbucket
    - A set of code changes in git tools is called a ‘pull request’ or ‘merge request’
    - if Pull requests are approved, the code changes can go into he main codebase
    - 
        
        ### what can you automate?
        
    - continuos integration
    - per change ephemeral enviroments
    - automated security scanning
    - notification to reviewers
    
    **Goal as DevOps Engineer**
    
    HELP DEVeloper change proposals get reviewed and merged within 24 hours of when they are made.
    
    ### ****THE CODE REVIEW****
    
    *THE PULL REQUEST  IS USUALLY reviewed by at least one other programmer and something called a code review where the other programmer will tell uou about code style will tell the proposing programmer whether there’s architectual problems,scaling problems, subjective things that can’t easily be automated. BUT that process of review can also be greatlly facilitated by a devops thecnology stack and devops automation can help with things like ephemeral environments, and from linting

    ### DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION
    
    ****************************************2000 , famouse post,**************************************** Can you make a build in one step?  CEO of stackoverflow.
    
    The second most important question for a developer organization.
    
    Things haven’t really changed since them 
    
    The effinciency of the build process isn’t the only goal of deployment automation. However
    
    - Depliy a feature to a certain set of users as a final test before rolling it out publically
    - Starting new version of services without causing downtime
    - Rolling back to he prior version in case somthing does go wrong.
    
    **Goals as DevOps Engineer**
    
    Have the right tools in place that facilitate deployment without having to have too much custom code.
    
    - SPINNAKER: Una herramienta DevOps para desplegar a producion  rapido, seguro y repetible, plataforma de entrega continua de codigo abierto para liberar cambios de software con alta velocidad y confianza. A través de una poderosa capa de abstracion, Spinnaker proporciona herramientas nos permite llevar el codigo de la aplicacion desde el commit hasta produccion.
        - Empresas como : Netflix, Google, Microsoft y Amazon pues la usan en su ciclo de desarrollo de software
    - HARNESS: s **es una compañía que se dedica a ayudar a las empresas a lograr sus resultados a través de la facilitación del proceso de desarrollo de software**, buscando que este sea lo más simple, automatizado y seguro posible.
    
    ### APPLICATION PERFORMANCE MANAGMENT
    
    - metrics: numeric measurements of key numbers in production
    - Logging: text descriptions of what is happening during processing
    - Monitoring: take metrics and logs to convert them into health metrics.
    - Alerting: If monitoring detects a problem. If notifies developer
    
    **DevOps Engineering  is vital for engineering teams, especially as the product matures.**
    
    IT’s more and more important to automate DevOps Engineering and to dedicate more resources to it. 
    
    # LESSON 2 :WHAT IS TDD?
    
    BEFORE TO GO TO REVIEW AUTOMATION. Let’s talk about testing, which is going to be really vital baseline information for when we talk about continuos integration, and other code review automation topic.
    
    **TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT DEFINITION**
    
    KNOWN sometines as TDD, it is a coding methodology where tests are written before code is written.
    
    - Quality assurance.
    - Unit test have roots in factories, building physical products.
    
    REMEMBER:
    
    - UNIT TESTS
    - INTEGRATION TESTS
    - System(end to end) tes ts
    - Acceptance test
    
    ### TDD GOALS
    
    - Know when something breaks and where
    - Know thtat the whole system is working correctly
    
    Test driven development is the methodology build on top of testing that’s become so popular in the past 10 o 20 years. 
    
    ************************CHECK: MOST DEVELOPERS THAT AREN’T USING TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT HAVE A SIMILAR WORKFLOW************************
    
    **WORKFLOW WITHOUT TDD**
    
    ![SINTDD.png](DEVOPS%20f9baf21db4084b6c862ca467aa1510d8/SINTDD.png)
    
    ![TDD.png](DEVOPS%20f9baf21db4084b6c862ca467aa1510d8/TDD.png)
    
    Result are the same regardless of method- TDD forces you to prioritize tasks
    
    IF YOU write the tests first because you know that you are building and it foreces you to think about which things are important to work on and which things can be put into a laser set of change.
    
    # **LESSON 3: CONTINUOS INTEGRATION**
    
    SO WE’VE TALKED ABOUT TESTING, where developers read scripts that make sure that their code conitnuos working way off into the futures years after they’ve made their code. And that leads us into our discussinon of ci. which is really one of the big topics that people tak about  in  a devops context. And CI STANDS for continuos integration. it refers to developers continuosly
    
    ## CONTINUOS INTEGRATION DEFINITION
    
    Developers pushin many small changes to a central git repository per day. These changes are verified by an automatic software that runs comprehensive tests to ensure no major issues are seen by customers.
